## 2026-07-03 00:00 BOOTSTRAP DONE [opus]
- What: quality-loop system created — skills (quality-loop, proof-sweep,
  resilience-sweep, perf-sweep, modularity-sweep, backlog-groom), state files,
  and 10 seed items Q-001…Q-010.
- Gates: n/a (infrastructure only, no engine code touched)
- Commit: (bootstrap session)
- Follow-ups: Q-001…Q-010 filed
- Notes: seeds ground in the 2026-06-27 CPU/RSS profile, the 2026-07-02
  concurrency-proof coverage doc, and docs/layering-roadmap.md. First real
  iterations should prefer Q-003/Q-005/Q-006 (baselines) so later regressions
  are detectable.
